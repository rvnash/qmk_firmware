. Bug where somehow screensaves comes back on?
. Remember Keyboard mode, OLED brightness, oled on/off
. Rearrange the info on the LED to make it aesthetically pleasing
. Find a spot on the std layers to switch modes (not where tab is now)
. Find a spot on the std layers for led control keycodes
. Colorize the STD layers RGB's
. Refactor to put the right stuff in keymap as opposed to keyboard
. Clean up code, put in copyright info, meet standards of qmk
